    I came into the world at the dawn of personal tech when apple 2 was king and I was learning how to use the command line to access games. I progressed from this to learn how to type on computers at an early age with my small motor skill deficit. After learning to type I grew up the early internet with organ trail and encarta. I was raised by a  logical analytical egineer for a father and a service oriented nurse for a mother.  My mother encouraged me to serve others which culminating in getting my Eagle Scout.  My professional journey began in campaign work on the Adam Taff campaign in high school and continuted in Missoui politics and  then led to  Washington, D.C. In D.C  I interned with Representative Sam Graves, the American Conservative Union, and Americans for Tax Reform. These experiences gave me a strong foundation in policy analysis and government affairs, and sparked my passion for making a positive impact through public service and international collaboration.

      My commitment to public service was further exemplified through my tenure in the United States military, including deployment aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. This role deepened my understanding of operational strategy and the intersection of defense and policy, reinforcing my dedication to advancing the public good.

      I have lived on five continents and taught on three, including significant experience in Title 1 schools, where I developed a deep appreciation for resilience, equity, and community engagement. These diverse experiences have shaped my global perspective and strengthened my commitment to advancing positive change through policy and technology. My goal is to leverage my background in international affairs and technical expertise to contribute to organizations such as the UN or Oxfam, ultimately aspiring to serve as a Middle East policy director with a strong focus on innovative, tech-driven solutions.
